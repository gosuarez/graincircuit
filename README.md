## Project Overview
GrainCircuit is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline bookmark management. This application offers a more intuitive and visually engaging way to organise, sort, and interact with bookmarks.

## Project Details
GrainCircuit provides a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to organise their bookmarks effortlessly. Its core features include:

- **Bookmarks/Index**: Displays all saved URLs.
- **Unsorted**: Collects bookmarks that have not been categorised yet.
- **Trash**: Stores deleted bookmarks, with the option for permanent removal.
- **Categories**: Allows users to create custom categories with color-coding for easy identification.
- **Profile**: Allows users to update their profile picture and username.
- **Settings**: Provides options for modifying email, password, and deleting the account.

Bookmarks are presented as interactive, rearrangeable cards, each displaying its associated image, title, category, and date. Users can further enhance organisation by adding custom tags to bookmarks. By default, two categories—"Unsorted" and "Trash"—are automatically created for each user, while additional categories can be customised with a unique name and one of eight predefined colours. A search bar helps users quickly find bookmarks by title, category, or tags, and pagination is used to manage large collections.

## Development
GrainCircuit’s backend is built with Django, responsible for user authentication, bookmark management, and metadata extraction. JavaScript manages dynamic interactions like drag-and-drop functionality, colour selection, sorting, and pagination. The project uses a hybrid rendering approach, combining server-side rendering with Django's templates and client-side dynamic content managed by JavaScript.
